# ZIPBOMB
2048 yottabyte Zip Bomb

This zip bomb uses overlapping files and recursion to achieve 7 layers with 256 files each, with the last being a 32GB file.

It is only 266 KB on disk.

(overlapping files are broken meaning the zip bomb is "corrupted" but you can still read them at least in Windows.)

If you extract 32-256^7.zip once you will be fine which is why I made 32-256.zip which is 1TB decompressed and if you extract it once you're done for
